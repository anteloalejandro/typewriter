# Typewritter

A bothersome time waster for the fun of it.

Made with raylib and raygui.

## Build

```bash
./build.sh
```

## TODO

- [ ] **Typing like you'd do in a typewritter**
  - [ ] Tabs, space and backspace only move the cursor
  - [ ] Enter jumps to a new line, but it does not act like a CR
  - [ ] Carriage Return key (which one?)
  - [ ] Key to delete text as if the typewritter had a type with corrector fluid. Deleting won't be visually perfect and may take multiple keystrokes
  - [ ] Allow writing multiple characters in the same area, one over another
- [ ] **Style**
  - [ ] Satisfying sound effects and animations
  - [ ] Multiple "typewritters" (different fonts and UI)
- [ ] **Interactive things, but *more obnoxious***
  - [ ] *Monkeytype* style typing test
  - [ ] *Typing of the Dead* style minigame
- [ ] **Extras**
  - [ ] Options to enable features not found in a typewritter or disable some that are (see above)
  - [ ] Unicode support
  - [ ] Cross-platform
